Instructions 
● Complete this exercise and submit either a zip of the solution or a link to a git repo ● Create a SPA (single page app) using JS/HTML/CSS. You can use any libraries, frameworks, etc. of your choice. 
Requirements 
● Solution should be responsive 
● Use this weather.json file as your datasource (sample data from Yahoo's Weather API) ● Show the "current" conditions for New York: 
○ Location (ie. New York, NY, USA) 
○ Current weather description (ie. sunny) 
○ Current temperature 
○ Today's high temperature 
○ Today's low temperature 
● Allow the user to toggle more data in the current conditions area: 
○ Wind Speed 
○ Humidity 
○ Pressure 
○ Sunrise/Sunset Time 
● Show the 7 Day forecast as a multi-line chart (use any charting library you would like) ○ Y axis should show the High and Low temperature as separate lines 
○ X axis should show 7 days (starting with the "current" day) 
○ The chart should have a tooltip that when activated shows: 
■ Day of the week 
■ High temperature 
■ Low temperature 
■ Weather description (ie. Breezy) 
● Bonus: Was this too easy? Want to make it a real app? Use the Yahoo's Weather API or Open Weather API with the default location set to New York, NY, and allow the user to change the location by zip code.
